    <p>I used Clip Studio Paint to make all of my images.</p>
    <p />
    <img src="cap01.jpg" class="inline"/>
    <p>For this image, I started with a picture of David Lynch's 2005 "FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION LAURA DERN" Oscar ad. I used the blur and airbrush tools to edit out Mrs. Dern (sorry Mrs. Dern), then cut out an image of myself holding a Madeleine tin, pasted it in, and added my name.</p>
